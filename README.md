# Deep Image Classifier using CNNs
This repository contains code for a deep image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into two categories: happy and sad.

## Overview
This image classifier is built using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, which are well-suited for image classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of happy and sad faces. The classifier can be used to predict the emotional state of faces in images, which can be valuable for applications such as sentiment analysis, facial recognition systems, and emotion detection in human-computer interaction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of a collection of happy and sad face images. Ensure that the dataset is structured appropriately with separate folders for each class.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used in this project consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the input images. The final layer is a fully connected layer with softmax activation to output the probability of each class.
